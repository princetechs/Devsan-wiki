**Introduction**

• Talk about how senior engineers **don’t wait for full clarity**—they make progress while getting answers.

• Example context: You had to integrate **Stripe Connect** with limited knowledge and partial client info.

**1. The Common Challenge**

• You’re handed a complex tool (Stripe Connect) with:

• No clear documentation from the client

• Unclear on fees, account types, etc.

**2. The Senior Engineer Approach**

  

**Don’t Block. Build Forward.**

  

“Instead of waiting for perfect clarity, start with what’s visible and build the backbone.”

  

• **Start with surface-level features**:

• Create a **donation button** (simplest Stripe checkout)

• Build a **test checkout session**

• Focus on **one-time payments before connect accounts**

**3. Build Isolated, Reusable Parts**

• Create:

• A **StripeService class** with create_checkout_session, create_account, etc.

• Helpers for formatting, handling errors, logging.

• Keep logic clean & modular — you can plug in new info later.

**4. Layer the Complexity Later**

  

Once client clarifies:

• Plug in fees, payout delays, etc. in your **already-built structure**.

• Add destination charges, platform fees, etc.

**5. Tips for Working with Complex APIs**

• Read **official API docs** as needed, don’t try to learn 100% upfront.

• Use **dashboard + test mode** to experiment.

• Write **good logs** to trace flows.

• Keep **questions ready** for the client based on what you tried.

**6. Final Thoughts**

• Being senior is not knowing everything, it’s **moving smartly with what you have**.

• Work in a way that future changes become **just config tweaks**.
