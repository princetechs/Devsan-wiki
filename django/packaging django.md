- so if a django-app is in local we can access it define in the installed app section of setteings.py like :- projectname.appname(saleor.auth)

- to make it accessable by every one we have to packing it with setuptools.
  
  so adding dependencies inside app not a issue it will stric or if statisfaied it will ignore like:
  -If your **parent project already includes** the same dependencies (like Django, djangorestframework, boto3, etc.), and your **reusable app (django-filehandler) also declares them in install_requires**, here’s what will happen:

---

### **✅ What will happen:**

  

When the parent project installs your app via:

```
pip install ./library/filehandler
# or from a package index
```

**pip will check for compatibility**:

- If the parent already has:
    

```
Django==4.2
djangorestframework==3.14.0
boto3==1.28.0
```

- and your app only requires:
    

```
"Django>=3.2",
"djangorestframework>=3.12.0",
"boto3>=1.20.0",
```

- ✅ Then everything is fine — **no changes will be made**. The versions already installed satisfy the requirements.
    

---

### **❗ What happens if versions conflict:**

  

If your app requires something more strict, like:

```
"Django==3.2"
```

but the parent project has:

```
Django==4.2
```

Then ❌ **pip will raise a version conflict error**, because the two requirements can’t be satisfied together.

---

### **✅ Best Practice for Reusable Django Apps:**

  

To **avoid conflicts**, always use **loose version ranges** in install_requires, like:

```
"Django>=3.2,<5.0",
"djangorestframework>=3.12.0,<4.0",
"boto3>=1.20.0,<2.0",
```

This ensures:

- Compatibility with a range of versions.
    
- You don’t force the parent project to downgrade/upgrade unnecessarily.
    
- You prevent pip from throwing conflicts unless there’s a true mismatch.

### **🔁 In summary:**

|**Situation**|**What Happens**|
|---|---|
|Dependencies match|✅ Nothing changes — everything works|
|Your app has looser constraints|✅ No problem — parent’s versions are used|
|Your app has stricter/pinned versions|❌ Conflict — pip will error out|

Let me know if you want to convert your Django app into a pip-installable package with editable mode (pip install -e), or if you plan to publish it.
