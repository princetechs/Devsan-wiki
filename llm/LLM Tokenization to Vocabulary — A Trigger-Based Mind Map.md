Perfect! 🔥 You want a **realistic, step-by-step learning mind map** that starts from:

  

> ❓ _“How do I use JupyterLab for fine-tuning an LLM?”_

  

…then follows your **actual discovery journey** — where each step leads naturally to the next question, just like you learned it.

  

So here’s your **OSBindian-style, trigger-based LLM learning map**, starting right from brew install jupyterlab.

# **🧠 Beginner’s Trigger-Based LLM Mind Map (Your Journey via JupyterLab)**

---

## **🟦 STEP 1: “I want to train a small LLM in JupyterLab”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “I installed JupyterLab. How do I train a small model?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

- ✅ You can fine-tune small models (like tinyllama or distilgpt2) inside JupyterLab
    
- Start by preparing:
    
    - Training data (text or JSONL)
        
    - A tokenizer
        
    - Model (from HuggingFace or Ollama)
        
    

  

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “Wait… what does it mean to _tokenize_ data before training?”

---

## **🟩 STEP 2: “What is Tokenization, and why do we need it?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “I see code using tokenizer.encode() — what is this doing?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

- Tokenization is breaking text into **tokens**
    
- Then mapping tokens to **numbers** (called input_ids)
    
- Models only work with **numbers**, not text
    

  

✅ Example:

```
"I love NLP" → ['I', 'Ġlove', 'ĠNLP'] → [40, 1212, 20275]
```

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “Are these token IDs always the same across models?”

---

## **🟨 STEP 3: “Are token IDs same in all models?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “If I use BERT or TinyLlama instead of GPT2 — are the token IDs the same?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

❌ No! Each model has its **own tokenizer + vocabulary**.

|**Model**|**“I” Token ID**|
|---|---|
|GPT-2|40|
|BERT|1045|
|TinyLlama|different|

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “So how are these vocabularies made before training?”

---

## **🟧 STEP 4: “How is a model’s vocabulary created?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “How do these token-to-ID mappings like ‘I’ → 40 happen?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

- Vocabulary is created by **training a tokenizer** on a large corpus using:
    
    - ✅ BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)
        
    - WordPiece
        
    - SentencePiece
        
    

  

✅ It merges the most common character pairs to form subword tokens.

  

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “So does ‘un’ get ID 100 because it appears 100 times?”

---

## **🟥 STEP 5: “Are token IDs based on frequency count?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “Is token ID = number of times it appears?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

❌ No!

Token ID depends on **merge order**, not frequency.

  

📌 "ieve" → 103 means it was the **103rd token merged**, not that it appeared 103 times.

  

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “Can token IDs change later, like during fine-tuning?”

---

## **🟫 STEP 6: “Do token IDs change during training?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “If I train the model more, will ‘I’ = 40 become ‘I’ = 50?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

❌ No — the tokenizer is **frozen** after training.

  

What **does** change during fine-tuning:

- Embeddings
    
- Attention weights
    
- Output behavior
    

  

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “What if I want my own vocabulary — like for Odia words?”

---

## **🟪 STEP 7: “Can I train my own tokenizer?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “If I want tokens like ‘ଜଣେ’, can I build my own tokenizer?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

✅ Yes! Use Hugging Face’s tokenizers or SentencePiece:

```
from tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer
tokenizer = ByteLevelBPETokenizer()
tokenizer.train(["your_corpus.txt"], vocab_size=5000)
```

Now:

- You get a new vocab.json
    
- Token IDs are assigned based on your **own dataset**
    

  

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “How does the full process flow from text to training?”

---

## **🟨 STEP 8: “What is the full LLM pipeline?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “I want the big picture. How does everything fit?”

  

⬇️

  

✅ Full LLM Data Flow:

```
1. Clean Text
2. Pre-tokenize (split, normalize)
3. Apply BPE or WordPiece
4. Generate tokens
5. Map to input_ids
6. Feed input_ids to Transformer model
7. Model outputs predictions
8. Decode output_ids back to tokens → text
```

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “Wait, what is the difference between BPE and n-gram then?”

---

## **🟩 STEP 9: “Is BPE the same as n-gram?”**

  

> _You ask:_

> “Are BPE and n-grams both tokenization methods?”

  

⬇️

  

**Answer**:

- ❌ No. **n-gram** = feature engineering (bigram, trigram)
    
- ✅ **BPE** = tokenizer algorithm that builds vocabulary
    

|**Term**|**Used in LLMs?**|
|---|---|
|n-gram|❌ Replaced by self-attention|
|BPE|✅ Core part of GPT, LLaMA, etc.|

🧠 Trigger:

  

> “Got it. Can I teach this flow to others now?”

---

## **🧭 Final Step: Your Teaching Summary Flow**

  

Here’s how you teach it (or recall it yourself):

  

### **🧬 Text → Tokens → Token IDs → Model → Predictions → Output Text**

  

Or as steps:

1. Load/prepare text data
    
2. Clean and normalize
    
3. Train (or use) tokenizer → BPE
    
4. Map tokens to IDs
    
5. Train/fine-tune model
    
6. Decode results from ID to text
