## 1. First, I wanted to fine-tune a small model using JupyterLab

### └── But I realized I first needed to understand tokenization.

#### └── That led me to the history of tokenization:
- n-gram (used in classic ML)
- BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)
- WordPiece / SentencePiece

#### └── I learned:
- Tokenization breaks text into subwords
- Then maps subwords to IDs (`input_ids`)
- Example: "I love NLP" → ['I', 'Ġlove', 'ĠNLP'] → [40, 1212, 20275]

---

## 2. Then, I returned to the idea of fine-tuning.

### └── Step 1: Clean your data
- Normalize text (lowercase, remove special chars)
- Decide whether to apply further preprocessing

### └── Step 2: Understand Corpus
- Corpus = all training text
- It is needed to **train or use a tokenizer**

### └── Step 3: Learn about Vocabulary
- Vocabulary is built from the corpus
- Used to convert tokens → token IDs

#### └── Important Realization:
- Token ID is based on **merge order**, not appearance count.
- Example: `"ieve"` → ID 103 (not because it appeared 103 times)

---

## 3. Once I have vocabulary:

### └── I can tokenize (encode) text
- `tokenizer.encode("Hello world")` → `[15496, 995]` (for GPT-2)

### └── Then I can send the input IDs to the model
- With the fine-tuning prompt/response pairs

## **1. I wanted to fine-tune an LLM. But first… what is tokenization?**

  

> ❓ _How do I send text to a model?_

  

⬇️

  

### **🔹 1.1** 

### **Tokenization**

  

> Convert text → subword tokens → token IDs

> Example:

```
"I love NLP" → ['I', 'Ġlove', 'ĠNLP'] → [40, 1212, 20275]
```

## **📚** 

## **2. This made me curious: How did tokenization evolve?**

  

### **🔸 2.1** 

### **n-gram**

- Old method: “I love NLP” → [“I”, “love”, “NLP”], [“I love”, “love NLP”]
    
- Used in ML (Naive Bayes, TF-IDF), **not** in LLMs
    

  

### **🔸 2.2** 

### **Subword Tokenization**

- BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)
    
- WordPiece, SentencePiece
    

  

> ✅ These split unknown/rare words into common parts:

> "unbelievable" → ['un', 'believ', 'able']

---

## **🧰** 

## **3. Before training or fine-tuning, what do I need?**

  

### **🔹 3.1** 

### **Clean your text data**

- Remove extra symbols, normalize casing, punctuation
    
- Not required: n-grams (LLMs don’t use this)
    

  

### **🔹 3.2** 

### **Prepare your corpus**

  

> A **corpus** is the entire body of text used to:

  

- Train the tokenizer
    
- Build the vocabulary
    

---

## **🧾** 

## **4. How is the Vocabulary built?**

  

### **🔸 4.1 Tokenizer training on corpus:**

- BPE scans text for most frequent subword pairs
    
- Builds vocabulary like:
    

```
"I" → 40  
"love" → 1212  
"believ" → 103  
```

  

  

> ❗ **Important**: "believ" → 103 means it was the **103rd merge**,

> **not** that it appeared 103 times.

---

## **🔐** 

## **5. Understanding Token IDs**

  

### **🔹 5.1 Token IDs are fixed after tokenizer training**

- Once "I" = 40, it stays 40 forever
    
- Token ID ≠ frequency
    
- Vocabulary and token IDs are **frozen** before model training

## **🧠** 

## **6. Encoding Text for Fine-Tuning**

  

> You now have:

> ✅ Cleaned Text

> ✅ Tokenizer

> ✅ Vocabulary (token → ID)

  

### **🔸 6.1 Tokenize and encode your text**

```
tokenizer.encode("I love NLP") → [40, 1212, 20275]
```

### **🔸 6.2 This encoded sequence is sent to the model**

  

Used in fine-tuning datasets like:

```
{"prompt": "Translate 'Hello' to Hindi.", "response": "नमस्ते"}
```

## **🔁** 

## **7. Fine-Tuning the LLM**

  

Once you have:

- input_ids
    
- prompt-response pairs
    

  

You fine-tune by:

- Sending batches of tokenized data
    
- Updating the model’s weights (not token IDs)
    
- Improving performance on your specific task/domain
