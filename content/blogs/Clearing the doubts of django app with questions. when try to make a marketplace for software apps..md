# 🧠 Django Essentials: Questions & Answers by Sandip

### ✅ What is a Django App?

- A **Django app** is a **self-contained module** with its own models, views, templates, URLs, etc.
    
- Think of it as a **feature or component**, not just a controller.
    

> ❗ It’s not a controller — it includes models, views (controller-like), templates, and more.

---

### ✅ Can I create an app without a Django project?

- Yes, technically you can run:
    
    ```bash
    django-admin startapp myapp
    ```
    
    But it won't be usable unless added into a **Django project** that provides settings and context.
    

---

### ✅ Can I make or install an app inside another app?

- Django does **not support apps inside apps** directly.
    
- Instead, structure reusable apps **at the project level**, and install them via `INSTALLED_APPS`.
    

---

### ✅ Can I install a package only for a specific app?

- **No**, Python and Django don’t support per-app packages.
    
- All dependencies go into the **global environment or project `requirements.txt`**.
    

> 💡 But you can document per-app dependencies in `llm/requirements.txt` for reuse.

---

### ✅ If I reuse an app (like `llm`) in another project, how do dependencies follow?

- You need to:
    
    - Package the app (`llm`) as a **Python package**
        
    - Include its dependencies in a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`
        
    - Then install it via `pip install` in the new project

### ✅ How to make a Django app a reusable Python package?

Use **cookiecutter-django-app**:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django-app
```

> 🎯 This generates a ready-to-publish, reusable app with packaging tools, tests, and structure.

---

### ✅ Can Django packaged apps show models in Django Admin?

- Yes, if you include:
    
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import MyModel
    admin.site.register(MyModel)
    ```
    
    And the app is in `INSTALLED_APPS`, the models will show up in Django admin.

### ✅ What is the role of a Django App in MVC?

|Django Term|MVC Equivalent|
|---|---|
|`views.py`|Controller|
|`models.py`|Model|
|`templates/`|View|

> 🔁 So a Django app wraps all three — it’s a **complete MVC feature unit**.

---

### ✅ What was in the image structure?

Apps like `RelayApp` and `FileHandlerApp` were **reusable Django apps** installed across multiple projects. They were treated as **dependencies**.

---

### ✅ Is there a “launcher” to run a single Django app?

- Django needs a **project** for `INSTALLED_APPS`, DB settings, etc.
    
- But you can:
    
    1. Create a **minimal project wrapper** just for one app.
        
    2. Use a **custom runner script** (standalone Python file).
        
    3. Dockerize each app for **microservice-style use**.
        

---

### ✅ Are there alternatives to `cookiecutter-django-app`?

|Tool|Use Case|
|---|---|
|`copier-django-app`|Modern templating alternative to cookiecutter|
|`django-app-template`|Community skeleton|
|`pyscaffoldext-django`|PyScaffold-based setup|
|`django-shared-apps`|Shared/tenant-based app architecture|
|`hatch`, `flit`|Modern Python packaging via `pyproject.toml`|
|Manual setup|Add `setup.py`, `MANIFEST.in`, etc. by hand|
