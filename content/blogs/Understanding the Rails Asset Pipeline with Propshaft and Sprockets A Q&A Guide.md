Managing and serving static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images is an essential part of any Rails application. But how exactly does the Asset Pipeline work? And what role do Propshaft and Sprockets play in it? Let’s dive in with a series of questions and answers to make this process clearer.

  

**Q1: What exactly is the Rails Asset Pipeline?**

  

**A1:** The Rails Asset Pipeline is a mechanism for managing static assets (CSS, JavaScript, and images) in your application. It helps:

• Compile and minify assets.

• Add cache-busting fingerprints to filenames.

• Serve assets efficiently in production.

  

**Q2: What is the purpose of SCSS compilation in Rails?**

  

**A2:** When working with Rails and SCSS, the goal is to compile SCSS into CSS. This ensures your stylesheets are:

• Properly optimized and minified for production.

• Available for your application to load, either directly or via a manifest file.

  

**Q3: What does manifest.js do in Rails?**

  

**A3:** The manifest.js file in Rails is a configuration file that lists all the assets that should be included in your application. Here’s a breakdown of its contents:

  

//= link_tree ../images

//= link_tree ../../javascript .js

//= link_tree ../../../vendor/javascript .js

//= link_tree ../builds

//= link application.css

  

**Q4: Can you explain each line in the** manifest.js **file?**

**A4:** Sure! Let’s break it down:

• //= link_tree ../images: Includes all images in app/assets/images.

• //= link_tree ../../javascript .js: Includes all JavaScript files in app/javascript.

• //= link_tree ../../../vendor/javascript .js: Includes third-party JavaScript files in vendor/javascript.

• //= link_tree ../builds: Includes files from app/assets/builds, where assets generated by tools like Webpack go.

• //= link application.css: Specifically links the application.css file.

  

**Q5: How does asset fingerprinting work in Rails?**

  

**A5:** In production, Rails applies a **fingerprint** to your assets. This fingerprint is a unique hash based on the file content, ensuring that assets are cached properly and browsers fetch updated versions when needed.

  

**Q6: How do fingerprinted files look in production?**

**A6:** After running rails assets:precompile, fingerprinted assets will look like this:

• application.css becomes application-a2d4c5e6f7.css.

• An image logo.png might become logo-f761237864.png.

  

These files are saved in the public/assets directory for efficient caching and serving.

  

**Q7: In development, why are assets working even though they are not in the public/assets directory?**

  

**A7:** In development, Rails serves assets directly from source files without needing precompiled files in public/assets. Here’s why:

1. Rails compiles assets **on the fly** when requested.

2. The compiled files are served directly from memory, not from disk.

3. The manifest.js file still plays a key role in determining which assets to include.

  

**Q8: I’m seeing a fingerprinted CSS file URL like /assets/application-d3e7bd71.css, but I can’t find the file in my project. Why is that?**

  

**A8:** This is perfectly normal! In development:

• Rails dynamically generates **fingerprinted URLs** for assets.

• The fingerprint (e.g., d3e7bd71) is based on the content of your SCSS or CSS file.

• **The file doesn’t physically exist on disk**, but Rails serves it from memory.

  

If you look at the **Network tab** in your browser’s developer tools, you’ll see that Rails is handling the request for the fingerprinted file and serving the content dynamically.

  

**Q9: I’m using Propshaft instead of Sprockets. Does that change anything?**

  

**A9:** Yes, using Propshaft is different from Sprockets. Propshaft is a modern, lightweight alternative to the traditional asset pipeline. Here’s how it behaves:

• **In development**: It compiles and serves assets directly from memory, without writing them to disk.

• **In production**: Propshaft still generates precompiled fingerprinted assets and stores them in public/assets.

• **It’s more efficient**: No need for disk I/O in development; changes are detected and processed in real-time.

  

**Q10: How does Propshaft handle the stylesheet_link_tag in my views?**

  

**A10:** When you use:

  

<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>

  

Propshaft does the following:

1. It checks the manifest.js for the asset (application.css).

2. It generates a fingerprinted URL like /assets/application-d3e7bd71.css.

3. In development, **the CSS is served from memory**, not from a physical file on disk.

  

When you make changes to your SCSS or CSS, Propshaft:

• Automatically detects the changes.

• Updates the in-memory version and changes the fingerprint.

  

This is why you can see the fingerprinted URL, but it doesn’t correspond to a physical file.

  

**Q11: How does the data-turbo-track="reload" work with Propshaft?**

  

**A11:** The data-turbo-track="reload" attribute ensures that Turbo (Rails’ hotwire framework) will reload the page if the fingerprinted asset changes. This is essential for making sure users always see the latest version of the CSS, without needing a full page refresh.

  

**Q12: Can you summarize how the asset pipeline works in Rails with Propshaft?**

  

**A12:** Sure! Here’s a quick recap:

• **In development**: Propshaft compiles assets on the fly and serves them from memory with fingerprinted URLs.

• **In production**: Propshaft precompiles assets, applies fingerprints, and stores them in public/assets.

• **Manifest file**: Links to your assets and helps Rails figure out what to compile and include.

• **Fingerprinting**: Ensures proper cache control and that browsers always load the latest version of assets.

  

Rails with Propshaft is an efficient way to manage assets, offering both real-time compilation in development and optimized performance in production.

  

**Conclusion:**

  

Understanding the Rails Asset Pipeline, whether you’re using Sprockets or Propshaft, is key to building fast and efficient applications. By leveraging asset fingerprinting, manifest files, and real-time asset compilation, Rails ensures that your assets are served optimally, both in development and production.
