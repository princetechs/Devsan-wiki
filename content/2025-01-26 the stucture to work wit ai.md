## Objective

Ensure thorough documentation and tracking of project updates during development sessions, allowing any AI agent to seamlessly pick up from where the previous session left off.

## Instructions

1. **Readme File Review**
    
    - Before starting work on any project, review the README file to understand the project's goals, structure, and requirements.
    - **If the README is missing**:
        
        - Automatically generate a README file that includes:
            
            - **Project Goals**: A brief description of the project's purpose and objectives.
            - **Project Structure**: An outline of the project's directory structure.
            - **Library Dependencies**: A list of libraries and dependencies used in the project.
            - **Database Schema**: An overview of the database schema, including a JSON schema file to represent its structure clearly.
            
        
    
2. **Session Updates**
    
    - At the end of each development session, document the following:
        
        - **Project Structure**: Outline any changes made to the project structure.
        - **Library Additions**: List any new libraries or dependencies added to the project.
        - **Database Schema Updates**:
            
            - Document any changes made to the database schema.
            - Update the JSON schema file if changes are made.
            
        
    
3. **Application Flow and Components**
    
    - Provide an overview of the application flow, detailing how different components interact.
    - Include diagrams or flowcharts if applicable to visualize the application architecture.
    
4. **Continuity for Future Sessions**
    
    - Ensure that all documentation is clear and organized so that any AI agent can easily understand where work left off.
    - Highlight key decisions made during the session, along with any pending tasks or issues that need attention in future sessions.
    

## Format for Documentation

- Use clear headings and bullet points for easy readability.
- Ensure that all updates are concise yet comprehensive, allowing for quick reference in future sessions.
