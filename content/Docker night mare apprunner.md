Buildx is an extended build command for Docker that provides enhanced building capabilities beyond the traditional `docker build` command. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### What is Docker Buildx?

Buildx is a Docker CLI plugin that extends the build capabilities of Docker, providing several key improvements:

1. **Multi-Architecture Support**

- Allows building Docker images for multiple architectures from a single command
- Enables creating images that can run on different platforms (e.g., linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64)
- Solves cross-platform compatibility issues

2. **Key Features**

- Create multi-arch images
- Build for different CPU architectures
- Improved caching mechanisms
- Advanced build outputs
- Support for more complex build scenarios

### Basic Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a builder instance with multi-arch support
docker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container

# Use the new builder
docker buildx use multiarch

# Build for multiple architectures
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t your-image:tag \
  --push \
  .
```

### Practical Benefits

- Solve compatibility issues (like your current ARM64 vs AMD64 problem)
- Create universal images that work across different systems
- Simplify cross-platform development and deployment
